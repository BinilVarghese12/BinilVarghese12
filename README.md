## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with strong programming skills, excellent time management, and a deep sense of responsibility. I am passionate about securing digital systems and protecting sensitive data in an era where virtual threats can have greater impact than physical ones. Iâ€™m particularly interested in contributing to organizations that prioritize robust digital defense, and I aim to develop my skills further through a cybersecurity degree apprenticeship. With a commitment to constant growth and integrity, Iâ€™m excited to support the evolving security needs of the digital world.
